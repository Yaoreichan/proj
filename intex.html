			<p class="sectionTag text-big">About US</p>
			<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Our work started in 2002, When we started, we knew that there were community organisations using football to catalyse change in their societies.
                We based our action on the belief that, to achieve global change, we needed to connect the dots, we needed to create the team, 
                We created the streetfootballworld network to identify, connect and empower community organisations that have demonstrated to have a sustainable social impact in their communities,
                 and enable them to do more. Our network currently includes 135 network members that, together, reach over two million people in 90 countries.
                For over 15 years, we have been implementing social impact strategies in cooperation with our network members and a wide range of partners –
                 from FIFA and UEFA to sponsors, governments and private partners, who believe in the quality standards that underpin the work of our network.

			<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Football-based development programmes present a unique approach to empowering young people.
                But they are not always easy to create. That’s why we provide a simple methodology, football3,
                 that allows community organisations to implement tailored programmes in line with their local need.
                  We also provide our partners with the opportunity to invest in these and many other football-based development programmes being carried out around the world.</p>
